# Tetris 

In October 2015 I attended a Ruby course and I was looking for something interesting to implement with this language. Looking around the web I found two interesting resources in which a Tetris game is implemented using this language.

These two resources are the following:
1. a Tetris clone written by Kamen Kitanova for the "Programming in Ruby" course at FMI, 
   University of Sofia, 2012. You can download source code from [here!](http://www.gamedev.net/blog/1241/entry-2254256-tetris-in-ruby/)
2. a Tetris clone written by LLexi Leon you can find on github [here|https://github.com/llexileon/rubytetris]

I studied these resource to learn the Ruby language and later I tried to do some changes according to my taste. The result are reported here.
