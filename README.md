# Tetris 

## Why another Tetris?
In October 2015 I attended a Ruby course and I was looking for something interesting to implement with this language. Looking around the web I found two interesting resources in which a Tetris game is implemented using this language.

These two resources are:

1. a Tetris clone written by Kamen Kitanova for the "Programming in Ruby" course at FMI, 
   University of Sofia, 2012. You can download source code [from here](http://www.gamedev.net/blog/1241/entry-2254256-tetris-in-ruby/)
2. a Tetris clone written by LLexi Leon you can [find on github here](https://github.com/llexileon/rubytetris)

I studied these resources to a better understanding of Ruby language and later I tried to do some changes just to see what happened. These two resources gave me also the possibility to learn more on Game Programming. This repository contains the result of my study that I hope to document deeply. I hope this effort will be helpful for someone else interested in Game and Ruby programming.

## Usage

Here the necessary steps to run Tetris. The assumption here is that you are using Windows as operating system. For Linux and Mac the differences should me minimal.

1. Download Github [from here](https://desktop.github.com/) and install it on your Windows.
2. Download Ruby [from here](http://railsinstaller.org/en) and install it.
3. Open a github shell
4. Run the command: _cd c:\_
5. Run the command: _git clone https://github.com/sasadangelo/Tetris.git_. The folder C:\Tetris will be created with source code inside.
